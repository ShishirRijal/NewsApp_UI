    title: 'No, America is not on the brink of a civil war',

        '''Acording to a number of polls and surveys, significant majorities of Republican-aligned voters seem to believe the big lie that Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 US presidential election and, consequently, the Biden administration is illegitimate
Taking these data at face value, a growing chorus insists that we’re living in a “post-truth” era, where members of one political party, the Republican party, can no longer tell facts from falsehood. As a result of the Republican party becoming unmoored from reality, the narratives typically continue, America is drifting headlong into a fascist takeover or a civil war.
Fortunately for all of us, these dire predictions are almost certainly overblown. We are not living in a “post-truth” world. We are not on the brink of a civil war. The perception that we are is almost purely an artifact of people taking poll and survey data at face value despite overwhelming evidence that we probably shouldn’t.
For instance, in the wake of the 2016 election, Trump claimed to have had higher turnout at his inauguration than Barack Obama did. Subsequent polls and surveys presented people with pictures of Obama and Trump’s inauguration crowds and asked which was bigger. Republicans consistently identified the visibly smaller (Trump) crowd as being larger than the other. A narrative quickly emerged that Trump supporters literally couldn’t identify the correct answer; they were so brainwashed that they actually believed that the obviously smaller crowd was, in fact, larger.

    title: "Stop describing academic teaching as a ‘load’",
    text: '''
University academics are often asked, “What do you teach?” Although some will reply by touching on some aspect of their specialty, often the most-honest answer would be, “as little as possible”.
The source of this attitude is plain to see in academic parlance: teaching, in particular undergraduate teaching, is often referred to as a ‘load’ — implicitly, a burden — and the reward for shouldering it is often small compared with that for other responsibilities, such as research or administration.
Despite having once been students themselves, most academics at research universities begin their careers by focusing not on teaching but on research. They understand that most tenure evaluations will have little to do with what goes on in the classroom. Research excellence is expected, but the bar for teaching is set lower, and linkage between the two activities is often weak.
When I began my academic career more than 30 years ago, I aspired to my current job not because of a desire to teach, but because of an aspiration to understand the world in new ways through my science. Not much happened in my early career to modify this point of view; for me, teaching was an obstacle to ‘proper’ academic work: research.
Institutional culture seemed to agree with me. I was given no formal instruction in how to teach, but was offered workshops designed to help me secure more external funding. This led to some tension in my classroom, because it seemed to me that although I was expected to spend a fair bit of time preparing and delivering my courses, this work would not matter in my evaluations. The students could sense this tension. However, the situation improved when I realized that the best way to teach is to relax, and that I could relax because the institution wasn’t paying much attention — so my career would not be at risk if I made a mistake in the classroom. Realizing that the only ones who needed to be satisfied were myself and my students helped me to calm down. The ‘burden’ was lifted, and I began to look at teaching as an opportunity.

    title: "Here are the odds you’ll outlive your money",
    text: '''
McQuarrie arrived at this 1965 worst-retirement-start date when measuring the probabilities that a retiree would outlive his or her money. He analyzed a much larger data set than most previous studies, which have largely focused on just the U.S. markets since the 1920s. McQuarrie, in contrast, analyzed U.S. data back to 1793 and global markets back to 1864.

He came up with both good and bad news. The bad: The odds of running out of money in retirement are significantly greater than prior studies had concluded. That’s because those prior studies based their return assumptions on U.S. history since the mid-1920s. Other countries’ markets, as well as the U.S. markets prior to the mid-1920s, frequently performed less well.

The good news: Retirees and near-retirees have several portfolio fixes available to them that dramatically reduce the odds that a stock-bond portfolio will run out of money for they pass. Here’s a summary of these fixes that McQuarrie identified:

Invest in a total bond market index fund instead of long-maturity bonds

This seems like a minor fix, but actually has a big impact, according to McQuarrie. By investing in a total bond market index fund, you significantly reduce the average duration of the bonds you own. A balanced portfolio containing such a fund and equities did a better job dealing with “the diverse challenges a retiree might face” than a portfolio of equities and long-term bonds.''',

    title: "Who Was Leonardo Da Vinci's Mother? This Researcher Knows",
    text:
        '''An Oxford University researcher has claimed to have solved the mystery behind the identity of Leonardo da Vinci's mother, five centuries after the Italian artist's death. The identity of Leonardo da Vinci's mother has remained elusive, although the genius artist who painted the Mona Lisa is one of the greatest cultural figures in history.
Researchers have claimed that his mother, Caterina, gave birth to an illegitimate son from a relationship with a lawyer when she was 15 years old. The speculation in recent years is that she was a slave.
Now, an art historian at Britain's Oxford University has claimed that the full name of Leonardo da Vinci's mother was Caterina di Meo Lippi. Professor Martin Kemp said Caterina was a poor peasant, probably an orphan, living with her grandmother in a decrepit farmhouse about a mile from Vinci in the Italian Tuscan hills, The Times reported.
The name emerged from previously overlooked archives in Florence and Vinci, including property tax records, Mr Kemp said. Caterina's father disappeared when she was young, leaving her to be brought up by her grandmother.
In 1451, when Caterina was 15, she became pregnant by Ser Piero da Vinci, 25, a lawyer working in Florence, Mr Kemp said.

        "Flutter 2.8 brings performance boost and new Dart features, as Google highlights Flame game engine",
    text:
        '''Flutter 2.8, the latest update to Google’s massively cross-platform app development suite, comes with an automatic performance boost and new features for the Dart language.
If you haven’t yet had the chance to try it out, Flutter is a way to create apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, the web, and more, all from the same code. Since the launch of “Flutter 2” earlier this year, the project has seen incredible growth, as Google cites 375,000 Flutter apps in the Play Store, nearly half of which have launched since May.

Today, Flutter is getting a bump to version 2.8, for which the team has focused on improving the performance of apps on mobile devices. By simply updating to Flutter 2.8, you’ll gain these enhancements, and your apps should open faster as well as use less memory. Google is actively invested in these improvements for Flutter, as some of their core apps like Google Pay and Stadia are built with it.

Flutter 2.8 also includes a focus on making it easier to connect apps with backend services like Google’s Firebase. To that end, nearly the full suite of Firebase plugins for Flutter have been upgraded from “Beta” to “Stable.” Similarly, there’s now an official, easy-to-use widget for signing in to an app with Firebase Authentication, which covers the many edge cases, which should help save developers time and better ensure security.

As is often the case, this latest Flutter update also comes with a simultaneous update to the Dart programming language SDK, to version 2.15. Some of the previously mentioned performance boosts are thanks to this update, which means those who use Dart outside of Flutter should see some of those improvements too.

Beyond that, Dart 2.15 introduces “constructor tear-offs” which allow you to refer to a class’s constructor by name in situations like “forEach()” or “map()”. Depending on the structure of your app’s code, this might come particularly in handy for developing Flutter UI.

Meanwhile, Google is also taking time to highlight their partnership with Flame, a third-party game engine built on top of Flutter, which has reached its 1.0 stable release today. Flame is ready for 2D game development, complete with a game loop and support for necessary tools for physics, animation, and mapping.

    title: "Breakfast around the world: How different places start the day",
    text:
        '''When it comes to breakfast foods around the world, there are as many ways to enjoy the first meal of the day as there are to say "good morning."
From creamy cornbread cake in Brazil and savory Tunisian chickpea soup to fluffy Ukrainian pancakes and sweet coconut jam toasts in Singapore, these 21 international specialties offer a food option for every palate.
And even if the flavors in some of these dishes might be unexpected based on your typical choices, the presentations are likely familiar. Read through CNN Travel's list -- in no particular order -- and learn about the delicious diversity of our world's breakfast cultures. Maybe you'll even find some inspiration for your next meal.
On weekdays, the Swiss frequently stick to quick but filling breakfasts such as the traditional birchermüesli, the granola-style blend of oats with fruit and nuts that's usually served over thick yogurt.
But on weekends, it's time for Swiss brunch. Along with roesti (potato pancakes), cheeses and cold cuts, the centerpiece of the brunch table is zopf. This braided egg bread is similar to challah or brioche, and served with honey, butter and jam.
When you're having qurs (that's "breakfast" in Amharic, Ethiopia's official language), chances are you'll be eating porridge. While there are many varieties and names for hot grain cereals served throughout the country, savory genfo is one of the most popular.
Genfo is made by mixing barley flour with boiling water until a thick, sticky dough forms, then shaped into a mound with a well in the center. The well is then filled with clarified butter blended with berbere, the complex spice blend, and dollops of yogurt are often spooned around the edges of the genfo.
Japanese breakfasts fall squarely on the savory side of the food spectrum: In fact, much of what you can eat for breakfast in Japan wouldn't be out of place at any other meal of the day.
Many morning repasts consist of a selection of small plates, each with a few bites of a traditional Japanese dish.
Fish such as salmon or mackerel, miso soup, pickled vegetables and rice are all represented. There's also tamagoyaki, a slightly sweet rolled omelet made from thin layers of egg in a rectangular pan that gives it its signature shape.

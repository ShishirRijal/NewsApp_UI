    title: 'No, America is not on the brink of a civil war',

        '''Acording to a number of polls and surveys, significant majorities of Republican-aligned voters seem to believe the big lie that Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 US presidential election and, consequently, the Biden administration is illegitimate
Taking these data at face value, a growing chorus insists that we’re living in a “post-truth” era, where members of one political party, the Republican party, can no longer tell facts from falsehood. As a result of the Republican party becoming unmoored from reality, the narratives typically continue, America is drifting headlong into a fascist takeover or a civil war.
Fortunately for all of us, these dire predictions are almost certainly overblown. We are not living in a “post-truth” world. We are not on the brink of a civil war. The perception that we are is almost purely an artifact of people taking poll and survey data at face value despite overwhelming evidence that we probably shouldn’t.
For instance, in the wake of the 2016 election, Trump claimed to have had higher turnout at his inauguration than Barack Obama did. Subsequent polls and surveys presented people with pictures of Obama and Trump’s inauguration crowds and asked which was bigger. Republicans consistently identified the visibly smaller (Trump) crowd as being larger than the other. A narrative quickly emerged that Trump supporters literally couldn’t identify the correct answer; they were so brainwashed that they actually believed that the obviously smaller crowd was, in fact, larger.

    title: "Stop describing academic teaching as a ‘load’",
    text: '''
University academics are often asked, “What do you teach?” Although some will reply by touching on some aspect of their specialty, often the most-honest answer would be, “as little as possible”.
The source of this attitude is plain to see in academic parlance: teaching, in particular undergraduate teaching, is often referred to as a ‘load’ — implicitly, a burden — and the reward for shouldering it is often small compared with that for other responsibilities, such as research or administration.
Despite having once been students themselves, most academics at research universities begin their careers by focusing not on teaching but on research. They understand that most tenure evaluations will have little to do with what goes on in the classroom. Research excellence is expected, but the bar for teaching is set lower, and linkage between the two activities is often weak.
When I began my academic career more than 30 years ago, I aspired to my current job not because of a desire to teach, but because of an aspiration to understand the world in new ways through my science. Not much happened in my early career to modify this point of view; for me, teaching was an obstacle to ‘proper’ academic work: research.
Institutional culture seemed to agree with me. I was given no formal instruction in how to teach, but was offered workshops designed to help me secure more external funding. This led to some tension in my classroom, because it seemed to me that although I was expected to spend a fair bit of time preparing and delivering my courses, this work would not matter in my evaluations. The students could sense this tension. However, the situation improved when I realized that the best way to teach is to relax, and that I could relax because the institution wasn’t paying much attention — so my career would not be at risk if I made a mistake in the classroom. Realizing that the only ones who needed to be satisfied were myself and my students helped me to calm down. The ‘burden’ was lifted, and I began to look at teaching as an opportunity.

    title: "Here are the odds you’ll outlive your money",
    text: '''
McQuarrie arrived at this 1965 worst-retirement-start date when measuring the probabilities that a retiree would outlive his or her money. He analyzed a much larger data set than most previous studies, which have largely focused on just the U.S. markets since the 1920s. McQuarrie, in contrast, analyzed U.S. data back to 1793 and global markets back to 1864.

He came up with both good and bad news. The bad: The odds of running out of money in retirement are significantly greater than prior studies had concluded. That’s because those prior studies based their return assumptions on U.S. history since the mid-1920s. Other countries’ markets, as well as the U.S. markets prior to the mid-1920s, frequently performed less well.

The good news: Retirees and near-retirees have several portfolio fixes available to them that dramatically reduce the odds that a stock-bond portfolio will run out of money for they pass. Here’s a summary of these fixes that McQuarrie identified:

Invest in a total bond market index fund instead of long-maturity bonds

This seems like a minor fix, but actually has a big impact, according to McQuarrie. By investing in a total bond market index fund, you significantly reduce the average duration of the bonds you own. A balanced portfolio containing such a fund and equities did a better job dealing with “the diverse challenges a retiree might face” than a portfolio of equities and long-term bonds.''',

    text:
        '''An Oxford University researcher has claimed to have solved the mystery behind the identity of Leonardo da Vinci's mother, five centuries after the Italian artist's death. The identity of Leonardo da Vinci's mother has remained elusive, although the genius artist who painted the Mona Lisa is one of the greatest cultural figures in history.
Researchers have claimed that his mother, Caterina, gave birth to an illegitimate son from a relationship with a lawyer when she was 15 years old. The speculation in recent years is that she was a slave.
Now, an art historian at Britain's Oxford University has claimed that the full name of Leonardo da Vinci's mother was Caterina di Meo Lippi. Professor Martin Kemp said Caterina was a poor peasant, probably an orphan, living with her grandmother in a decrepit farmhouse about a mile from Vinci in the Italian Tuscan hills, The Times reported.
The name emerged from previously overlooked archives in Florence and Vinci, including property tax records, Mr Kemp said. Caterina's father disappeared when she was young, leaving her to be brought up by her grandmother.
In 1451, when Caterina was 15, she became pregnant by Ser Piero da Vinci, 25, a lawyer working in Florence, Mr Kemp said.

        "Flutter 2.8 brings performance boost and new Dart features, as Google highlights Flame game engine",
    text:
        '''Flutter 2.8, the latest update to Google’s massively cross-platform app development suite, comes with an automatic performance boost and new features for the Dart language.
If you haven’t yet had the chance to try it out, Flutter is a way to create apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, the web, and more, all from the same code. Since the launch of “Flutter 2” earlier this year, the project has seen incredible growth, as Google cites 375,000 Flutter apps in the Play Store, nearly half of which have launched since May.

Today, Flutter is getting a bump to version 2.8, for which the team has focused on improving the performance of apps on mobile devices. By simply updating to Flutter 2.8, you’ll gain these enhancements, and your apps should open faster as well as use less memory. Google is actively invested in these improvements for Flutter, as some of their core apps like Google Pay and Stadia are built with it.

Flutter 2.8 also includes a focus on making it easier to connect apps with backend services like Google’s Firebase. To that end, nearly the full suite of Firebase plugins for Flutter have been upgraded from “Beta” to “Stable.” Similarly, there’s now an official, easy-to-use widget for signing in to an app with Firebase Authentication, which covers the many edge cases, which should help save developers time and better ensure security.

As is often the case, this latest Flutter update also comes with a simultaneous update to the Dart programming language SDK, to version 2.15. Some of the previously mentioned performance boosts are thanks to this update, which means those who use Dart outside of Flutter should see some of those improvements too.

Beyond that, Dart 2.15 introduces “constructor tear-offs” which allow you to refer to a class’s constructor by name in situations like “forEach()” or “map()”. Depending on the structure of your app’s code, this might come particularly in handy for developing Flutter UI.

Meanwhile, Google is also taking time to highlight their partnership with Flame, a third-party game engine built on top of Flutter, which has reached its 1.0 stable release today. Flame is ready for 2D game development, complete with a game loop and support for necessary tools for physics, animation, and mapping.

    title: "Breakfast around the world: How different places start the day",
    text:
        '''When it comes to breakfast foods around the world, there are as many ways to enjoy the first meal of the day as there are to say "good morning."
From creamy cornbread cake in Brazil and savory Tunisian chickpea soup to fluffy Ukrainian pancakes and sweet coconut jam toasts in Singapore, these 21 international specialties offer a food option for every palate.
And even if the flavors in some of these dishes might be unexpected based on your typical choices, the presentations are likely familiar. Read through CNN Travel's list -- in no particular order -- and learn about the delicious diversity of our world's breakfast cultures. Maybe you'll even find some inspiration for your next meal.
On weekdays, the Swiss frequently stick to quick but filling breakfasts such as the traditional birchermüesli, the granola-style blend of oats with fruit and nuts that's usually served over thick yogurt.
But on weekends, it's time for Swiss brunch. Along with roesti (potato pancakes), cheeses and cold cuts, the centerpiece of the brunch table is zopf. This braided egg bread is similar to challah or brioche, and served with honey, butter and jam.
When you're having qurs (that's "breakfast" in Amharic, Ethiopia's official language), chances are you'll be eating porridge. While there are many varieties and names for hot grain cereals served throughout the country, savory genfo is one of the most popular.
Genfo is made by mixing barley flour with boiling water until a thick, sticky dough forms, then shaped into a mound with a well in the center. The well is then filled with clarified butter blended with berbere, the complex spice blend, and dollops of yogurt are often spooned around the edges of the genfo.
Japanese breakfasts fall squarely on the savory side of the food spectrum: In fact, much of what you can eat for breakfast in Japan wouldn't be out of place at any other meal of the day.
Many morning repasts consist of a selection of small plates, each with a few bites of a traditional Japanese dish.
Fish such as salmon or mackerel, miso soup, pickled vegetables and rice are all represented. There's also tamagoyaki, a slightly sweet rolled omelet made from thin layers of egg in a rectangular pan that gives it its signature shape.

        "Last-resort cancer therapy holds back disease for more than a decade",
    text:
        '''A few weeks after receiving an experimental cancer therapy that turns immune cells into tumour-killing hunters, Doug Olson’s doctor sat him down to give him news of his progress. “He said, ‘Doug, we cannot find a single cancer cell in your body,’” Olson recalls. “I was pretty convinced that I was done with cancer.”
Olson’s doctors, however, weren’t so sure. The year was 2010, and Olson was one of the first people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to receive the treatment, called CAR-T-cell therapy. When his doctors — including Carl June and David Porter at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia — wrote the protocol for the clinical trial that Olson was involved in, they hoped that the genetically engineered cells might survive for a month in his body. They knew that cancer research could be heartbreaking; they didn’t dare to expect a cure.
But more than ten years later, the immune cells continue to patrol Olson’s blood and he remains in remission. June is finally ready to admit what Olson suspected all along. “We can now conclude that CAR T cells can actually cure patients with leukaemia,” June told reporters at a press briefing describing results that were published in Nature on 2 February1.
CAR-T-cell therapies involve removing immune cells called T cells from a person with cancer, and genetically altering them so that they produce proteins — called chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs — that recognize cancer cells. The cells are then reinfused into the person, in the hope that they will seek out and destroy tumours.

In the years since Olson’s treatment, five CAR-T-cell therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, to treat leukaemias, lymphomas and myelomas. June estimates that tens of thousands of people have received CAR-T cell treatment.
But the therapy is expensive, risky and technically demanding. It remains a last resort, to be used when all other treatments have failed. Despite the treatment’s success for Olson, not everyone experiences durable remission of their cancer. In the beginning, only about 25–35% of CAR-T-cell recipients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia experienced a complete remission of their cancer, says Porter. With refinement, that percentage has increased over the years, he says, but some of these initial successes still lead to relapse. Tracking the treatment long-term could reveal clues as to what factors are important for lasting CAR-T-cell success.
For more than ten years, Porter and his colleagues analysed the CAR T cells in Olson and one other person treated in 2010, tracing the cells’ evolution and looking for any signs of safety concerns.
They found that the CAR T cells persisted, but the characteristics of the population shifted over time. Soon after infusion, a prominent population of T cells called CD8+ cells emerged. These are sometimes called killer T cells, and can identify and destroy cells that display unusual proteins, such as cancer cells or cells that are infected with a virus.
But over the years, a different type of CAR T cell became dominant. CD4+ T cells can take on a variety of functions in the immune system, but the researchers showed that both study participants had CD4+ cells with characteristics suggesting that they would be capable of killing leukaemia cells.

        "Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G vs Redmi Note 10 Pro: The Snapdragon 695 offers a decent generational performance boost",
    text:
        '''After releasing the Redmi Note 11 series in China months ago, Xiaomi finally brought the phones over to the global market, but with different hardware. The Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G, for example, trading in a MediaTek Dimensity 920 for a Snapdragon 695. That, on paper, looks like a downgrade on the Redmi Note 10 Pro's Snapdragon 732G. As we saw with the Snapdragon 678 and Redmi Note 11's Snapdragon 680, though, looks can be deceiving.
Starting with Geekbench, the Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G comes away with a score of 675 in the single-core test. The Redmi Note 10 Pro and its Snapdragon 732G score 563 in the same test. The Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G's dominance continues in the multi-core test, as its 1933 score handily surpasses the Redmi Note 10 Pro's score of 1728. 
From those numbers, the Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G and its Snapdragon 695 appear to have about a 15% CPU performance advantage over the Snapdragon 732G-powered Redmi Note 10 Pro. That gap is mirrored on AnTuTu, as the Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G records a score of 121,603 in the CPU test, versus the Redmi Note 10 Pro's 101,946. Ergo, a 20% edge for the newer phone.
The Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G continues its dominance on the GPU end, too, as it scores 101,082. The Redmi Note 10 Pro scores 93,022, which translates into an 8% advantage for the Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G. While 3DMark is generally better for GPU performance, it'd be surprising if 3DMark numbers differed wildly from AnTuTU's figures.
In conclusion, the Snapdragon 695-powered Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G is, indeed, a more powerful device than the Snapdragon 732G-powered Redmui Note 10 Pro. It's not a significant upgrade, though. Either way, that should gladden the hearts of fans, especially after the Redmi Note 11's Snapdragon 680 disappointed in tests versus the Redmi Note 10's Snapdragon 678.        ''',
